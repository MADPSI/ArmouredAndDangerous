# ArmouredAndDangerous
A mod for Spore: Galactic Adventures (2009)

Armoured & Dangerous adds new parts created from models used in Stellaris, a massive 4X Realtime Strategy Space Explorationa and Management game. The parts are available in all relevant, user-accessible editors.

Currently the mod contains 10 unique parts from the Necroid ship model set from the game (DLC content), and creature skin-colourable version of each. They are available in: Cell Editor (including Starting Cell Editor available via Project: Bacterioid), Early Creature Creator, Creature Editor, All Outfitters including Captain, Vehicle Editor & Building Editor (as both base structures and stackable details) and the Adventure Editor as Fixed Objects.

* *Note: This mod does not require, but greatly benefits from the presence of Dark Injection, enabling the use of Nudge/Depth/Cube Handles in all Editors.*

* *Note: This mod must be installed with the Spore ModAPI Easy Installer, part of the ModAPI Launcher Kit (http://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55 ... PI/Public/).*
